Setup:
make sure main camera is a higher depth
set target texture in miniMap Camera
add texture to material
add material to a plane
attatch plane to camera or to arm


The "What the heck does this do" table:

Dynamic MiniMap Display:
The "screen" that displays the map. Can be attatched to anything (like the wrist of the player)

MiniMap Viewer:
is a camera that only sees the minimap so it can display the minimap over any other object in the game
This can probably be removed when added to a vr player
aka: the minimap doesn not go behind walls.


Dynamic MiniMap Camera:
The camera in the sky looking at the entire map. Displays to a texture called "MiniMapTexture".

Desktop MiniMap Camera:
A different camera in the sky that displays at the bottom of the screen.
Use this one if using the dekstop player prefab. (The other camera disables up and down looking for some reason).
If you use this one, disable everything else in this table.
